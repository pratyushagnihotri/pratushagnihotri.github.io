I am working as Research Scientist at TU Darmstadt as a part of DFG: Collaborative Research Center 1053 MAKI subproject C2. I joined the Master's course in Computer Science at TU Darmstadt in 2013. In his master thesis work, he proposed and developed a decentralized crowd-sensing data collection framework using Information-Centric Networking (ICN) concepts to deal with post-disaster challenges in communication. The thesis was done in joint collaboration with Prof. Dr.-Ing. Michael Zink, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, USA. After his graduation, he worked as a software developer at axxessio GmbH, Darmstadt in the application and research areas of Internet of Things (IoT), Smart City, Voice assistant. Since June 2021, he is working as a Research Scientist at the Multimedia Communication Lab and primarily associated with  C2 subproject of DFG MAKI.
