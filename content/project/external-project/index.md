I am working as an Associated Researcher for the Parrot project, which is a collaborative research between the University of Oslo (Norway) and the Technical University of Darmstadt (Germany) funded by the Research Council of Norway (2020 â€“ 2023). The aim of this project is to find user-centric methods for real-time privacy protection for stream processing applications.
